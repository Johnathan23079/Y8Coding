During the reign of Emperor Yao, Zhuanxu's descendant General Gao Yao served as dali or Minister of Law. During the Xia dynasty, his ancestors adopted Li 理 as their surname. There are many tales about how 理 (reason) became 李 (plum). The most common one says the minister Li Zheng was executed by King Zhou of the Shang dynasty. Li Zheng's son and wife escaped and survived by eating plums. As a sign of gratitude, his descendants thereafter adopted the surname meaning 'plum'."
